_Punk Rock Version:_

(Verse 1)
He met his girlfriend on a date with her boyfriend
Café 871, where love went wrong
Whispers and laughter, their hearts on fire
Chicken and waffles, their love's desire

(Chorus)
He met his girlfriend on a date with her boyfriend
But now she's Candy Poppins, his sweet rebellion
Their love's sour-sweet ride
With or without, she's his heart's inside

(Verse 2)
They're burning bridges, and breaking rules
Their love's a wildfire, that refuses to cool
They'll take the highway, confidently in the wrong direction
No regrets, no looking back, their love's the only correction

(Chorus)
He met his girlfriend on a date with her boyfriend
But now she's Candy Poppins, his sweet rebellion
Their love's sour-sweet ride
With or without, she's his heart's inside

(Bridge)
Rednecks and rebels, they'll take the fall
But their love's the fire, that stands tall
From Ground Zero, they'll rise above
With Candy Poppins, he's found his love

(Chorus)
He met his girlfriend on a date with her boyfriend
But now she's Candy Poppins, his sweet rebellion
Their love's sour-sweet ride
With or without, she's his heart's inside
